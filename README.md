## File Structure
```plaintext
crypto-ticker-streamlabs.html
  - HTML: Handles the structure of the ticker.
  - CSS: Defines the styling, including scrolling animation and colors.
  - JavaScript: Fetches data from CoinGecko API and updates the ticker.
```

---

## Code Overview
### HTML
Defines the structure, including the container and debug panel:
```html
<div id="debug">Initializing...</div>
<div class="ticker-container">
    <div class="ticker-scroll" id="ticker">
        <div class="ticker-item">Loading cryptocurrency data...</div>
    </div>
</div>
```

### CSS
Handles the scrolling animation and visual styles:
```css
@keyframes scroll {
    0% {
        transform: translateX(100%);
    }
    100% {
        transform: translateX(-100%);
    }
}
```

### JavaScript
Fetches real-time cryptocurrency data from the CoinGecko API:
```javascript
async function fetchCryptoData() {
    try {
        const response = await fetch('https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/markets?vs_currency=usd&order=market_cap_desc&per_page=20&page=1&sparkline=false');
        const data = await response.json();
        // Process and display the data...
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching crypto data:', error);
    }
}
```

---

## How to Customize
### Update Coin Limit
Modify the `per_page` parameter in the API URL to change the number of coins displayed:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/markets?vs_currency=usd&order=market_cap_desc&per_page=10&page=1&sparkline=false');
```

### Adjust Animation Speed
Update the `animation-duration` in the CSS for faster or slower scrolling:
```css
.ticker-scroll {
    animation: scroll 120s linear infinite; /* Change 120s to your desired duration */
}
```

### Change Colors
Customize colors for price changes in the CSS:
```css
.price-up {
    color: #00ff00;
}
.price-down {
    color: #ff0000;
}
```

## Troubleshooting
### Ticker Doesnâ€™t Load
- Check if the hosted URL is correct.
- Verify API access (test the API URL in your browser).
- Ensure the Streamlabs Browser Source has an active internet connection.

### Debugging
- Use the `#debug` div to display error messages.
- Open the browser console (F12) to check for errors.
